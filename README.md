# Live Mission Recording - Autonomous Navigation Requirement 3

## What is This?

This repository contians a base implementation of the UX SDK [by DJI](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-UXSDK-Android), and a custom implementation of autonomous navigation for the DJI Mini 2 drone. The drone:
- Lifts up to the target location's height;
- Turns towards the target location;
- Moves forwards till the target location is reached;

## How to use the application?

If you want to execute these elements on the drone, you must:
- ***IMPORTANT:*** set the latitude, longitude and altitude of the target location you want the drone to visit before installing the application on the phone!
- Install the application on your Android phone;
- Connect the phone to the drone remote controller;
- Turn on the drone and the remote cotnroller;
- Launch the applicaiton;
- Click on "Complete Demo of Default UI Widgets" button;
- Click on "START" button to start teh autonomous navigation towards the predefined target location.

***ATTENTION*** - In case of emergencies (if the drone does not behave how you want it to), press the "STOP" button to halt the drone's behaviour.
